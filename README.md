## Description

Employees are the heart and soul of any business and that's why we decided to develop an app that is going to facilitate the staff management, using SQL databases and tables as the core. This app will keep a record of all your employees, their positions, salaries and managers making easy the decision making process when you're presented with any staff subject. That is with the three tables: departments,roles & employees, implemented that are going to show you all the companies departments, all the roles and their departments and all the employees and their relations with the other two tables.
